**Data Science**

Data Science is a field of study that combines programming skills, mathematics and statistics, and general knowledge to obtain information from structured and unstructured data. The data science process includes the stages of data processing, modeling, and evaluation. In addition, there is the data analysis and visualization stage to draw information from the data and facilitate delivery.

**Classification**

Data classification is a case of Supervised Learning which is processed in the data science process according to the target/label of the data used. For classification cases, there are several algorithms that can be used including Decision Tree, SVM, KNN, and others.

In this portfolio, I compared the Regression algorithm and several Classification algorithms in classifying the Mobile Price dataset obtained from Kaggle.
